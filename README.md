### Why are we interested in this domain?

### Examples of Relevant Data Driven Projects
* [Analyzing Cryptocurrency Markets Using Python](https://github.com/triestpa/Cryptocurrency-Analysis-Python) aims to procure and leverage raw data to uncover the behavior of cryptocurrency values. The creators argue that much of the available information on cryptocurrency markets is speculative and lacks a strong quantitative foundation. Thus, they strive to create this foundation which they then use to analyze trends in the market.  
* [Cryptofolio](https://github.com/FinTechies/Cryptofolio) provides high-level insights into the crypto market. The creators use PostgreSQL to perform time-series data analysis on cryptocurrency data beginning in 2010. The project includes clear visuals on the trends in Bitcoin and Ethereum while also addressing the divergence of the valuation of crypto between China and Japan.
* [Cryptoviz](https://github.com/Ameobea/cryptoviz) records and receives live order data from the Poloniex exchange using the Poloniex WebSocket API. It uses this data to create a visual that captures a high level of detail of the crypto market depth.
